 *  haval.h:  specifies the interface to the HAVAL (V.1) hashing library.
 *
 *      HAVAL is a one-way hashing algorithm with the following
 *      collision-resistant property:
 *             It is computationally infeasible to find two or more
 *             messages that are hashed into the same fingerprint.
 *
 *  Reference:
 *       Y. Zheng, J. Pieprzyk and J. Seberry:
 *       ``HAVAL --- a one-way hashing algorithm with variable
 *       length of output'', Advances in Cryptology --- AUSCRYPT'92,
 *       Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, 1993.
 *
 *      This library provides routines to hash
 *        -  a string,
 *        -  a file,
 *        -  input from the standard input device,
 *        -  a 32-word block, and
 *        -  a string of specified length.
